    "There usually is some dependence on the order of execution of cells in notebooks.  Initialize graphics and import modules/libraries need to be run before you try to plot anything.  Also, defining functions or variables should be done before you use them.  So, run cells sequentially from top to bottom.  Rerun cells after you open a notebook that was shutdown before.  One keyboard shortcut to run a cell is **Shift-Enter**.\n",

    "A great way to learn more about Scientific Python Environment is by working through [SciPy Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.org/) .  You can also practice Python at [W3Schools Python](https://w3schools.com/python/) .\n",
